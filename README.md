This repository demonstrates an uncommon Scala error related to type mismatches when attempting to use a class directly without proper instantiation. The code includes a class with an auxiliary constructor.  The primary constructor takes an integer argument. The auxiliary constructor creates an instance with the default value of 0. When using the class directly as a type (without creating an object instance), it throws a type mismatch error. The solution shows how to correctly use the class by instantiating objects.
